# LDRunner

LDRunner is for long distance runners, who incorporate races into their daily lives and would love to build a running community around it. Main features include tracking past and upcoming races, searching new races, and creating running-related blog posts. You will also be able to see your friends' recent activities and become aware of activities from people who share your current distance goal -- 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon.
